This project is team L's submission for the ReloadlyxFlutterwave Hackathon, running September-October 2021.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

To run this flutter app on your local computer, you need to have Android studio installed, as well as install an SDK Emulator.
Follow the steps here  to do so, if you haven't done yet. https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/crataristo4/bus_io-ReloadlyXFlutterwave.git


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## How It Works

Create An account

On Dashboard, Search for your trip by inputing required fields - destination, date, number of passengers

Select preferred provider, and book via flutterwave.

Earn loyalty points upon each booking

Return to Dashboard and Select Wallet Icon

Redeem your points via giftcards or airtime.


## Known Issues

When testing this app on your local simulator or device, Please note the below:

Number of passengers should be set to 2.

On seat selection, please ensure you select at least 2 seats to continue. Selecting just one would not move to the next screen.


These issues would be fixed as soon as possible. Had to rush to get this ready in time for submission
